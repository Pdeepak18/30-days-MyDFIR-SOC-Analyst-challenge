🚀 Elastic Agent and Fleet Server Setup Tutorial | Day 7
🎯 Objective

Install the Elastic Agent on a WinEndpoint-01 (Windows Server 2022 VM)

Enroll WinEndpoint-01 into the Fleet Server for centralized management

🛠️ Setup Overview

We will:

Set up a Fleet Server on an Ubuntu VM

Enroll a Windows Server 2022 VM (WinEndpoint-01) using Elastic Agent

Manage all configurations through the Fleet UI in Kibana

📌 Prerequisites

✅ Elasticsearch and Kibana already installed and running

✅ Ubuntu VM to act as the Fleet Server

✅ Windows Server 2022 VM (WinEndpoint-01) with RDP access

✅ Internet access or port forwarding configured so WinEndpoint-01 can reach the Fleet Server

🔧 Step-by-Step Instructions
🖥️ Step 1: Set Up Fleet Server on Ubuntu

SSH into your Ubuntu VM

Open a browser and visit:

http://<your-elasticsearch-vm-ip>:5601


Navigate to:

Management → Fleet → Add Fleet Server


Under Quick Start, provide:

Fleet Server name: <any-name>
Fleet Server host URL: https://<fleet-server-ip>:8220


👉 Use the IP address of your Ubuntu VM as <fleet-server-ip> (example: 172.31.0.6)

🧾 Step 2: Install Fleet Server on Ubuntu

Copy the Linux command generated in the Fleet UI

Paste it into your Ubuntu Fleet VM terminal

When prompted, type Y to confirm and install the Elastic Agent

✅ This turns your Ubuntu machine into a Fleet Server and connects it to Kibana.

🪟 Step 3: Enroll WinEndpoint-01 into Fleet

Go back to Kibana UI → Fleet → Agents

Click Add agent

Create or select a Custom Agent Policy (e.g., Windows Monitoring Policy)

Copy the Windows command shown in Kibana

On WinEndpoint-01 (Windows Server 2022 VM):

Open PowerShell as Administrator

Paste the command and run it

Confirm installation by typing Y when prompted

✅ This installs the Elastic Agent and enrolls WinEndpoint-01 into the Fleet UI.

✅ Post-Setup Verification

Go back to Fleet → Agents in Kibana

WinEndpoint-01 should show as online

It should be assigned to your custom policy

📌 Summary
Component	Action
Ubuntu VM	Acts as Fleet Server
Kibana UI	Used for agent enrollment
WinEndpoint-01	Enrolled into Fleet using Elastic Agent
Fleet	Centralized policy & data control
📚 Additional Tips

Use HTTPS with valid certs in production

Keep WinEndpoint-01 isolated when practicing (better security)

Monitor agent logs at:

Windows: C:\Program Files\Elastic\Agent\data\elastic-agent.log

Linux: /opt/Elastic/Agent/data/elastic-agent.log

Later, add integrations (Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, Security events) in Kibana
